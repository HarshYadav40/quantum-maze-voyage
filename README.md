# ⚛️ Quantum Search Visualizer

An interactive web app that compares **classical** and **quantum-inspired** algorithms in solving mazes — turning abstract quantum computing concepts into something visual, fun, and educational.

## 🚀 About the Project

**Quantum Maze Voyage** is built to demonstrate how **quantum computing principles**, such as *superposition* and *Grover’s search algorithm*, can speed up problem-solving compared to classical search methods.  
You can watch both approaches side-by-side as they attempt to find the maze exit.

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 **Two Modes** – Classical Search & Quantum-Inspired Search  
- 🌀 **Quantum Maze** – A special maze layout inspired by quantum walk problems  
- 📊 **Stats Panel** – Track steps, time taken, and success rate  
- ⚛️ **Quantum Circuit Diagram** – A simplified visual of Grover’s algorithm  
- 💡 **Tooltips** – Quick explanations of quantum concepts for beginners  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works on desktop and mobile

## 🖼 How It Works

1. **Classical Mode**  
   - Explores paths sequentially until it finds the exit.

2. **Quantum Mode**  
   - Inspired by Grover’s algorithm, it searches more efficiently by evaluating multiple possibilities at once.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend (Optional):** Python Flask or Node.js (for future quantum hardware integration)  
- **Quantum SDK:** [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) (for circuit diagrams and simulations)  
- **Visualization:** HTML Canvas / CSS animations

## 📚 Educational Value

Quantum Maze Voyage makes abstract concepts **tangible**:
- **Superposition:** Trying multiple paths at the same time.
- **Quantum Search:** Finding the correct solution faster than classical brute-force.
- **Quantum Walks:** Movement patterns inspired by quantum mechanics.
